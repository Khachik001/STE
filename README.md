## Automated GitOps Workflow in Action

Welcome to the automated GitOps workflow of our project. This section provides an overview of the key components and their respective roles in orchestrating a seamless and controlled deployment process.

### The Key Components

Our GitOps workflow relies on a set of integrated technologies, each with a specific purpose:

#### Terragrunt - The Infrastructure Orchestrator

Terragrunt serves as the architectural cornerstone of our infrastructure. It is responsible for defining and provisioning AWS resources, ensuring that changes made to the infrastructure code are smoothly executed. With Terragrunt, we achieve Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation, allowing us to maintain a clear and version-controlled representation of our infrastructure.

#### GitHub Actions - The Composer of Docker Images

GitHub Actions takes on the role of a composer, orchestrating the creation of Docker images with each code update. This continuous integration (CI) tool ensures that our code is transformed into containerized applications, ready for deployment. The result is a streamlined and automated image building process that guarantees consistency across our deployments.

#### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) - The Image Repository

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) serves as the repository for our Docker images. It securely stores and manages our container images, ensuring their availability for deployment. ECR plays a vital role in preserving the history of our application images, providing a stable and reliable source for our Kubernetes clusters.

#### Argo CD - The Deployment Conductor

Argo CD takes on the crucial role of orchestrating deployments. It continuously monitors our Git repository for changes and maintains the desired state of our Kubernetes cluster. Argo CD ensures that the cluster aligns with the code in the repository, guaranteeing a consistent and controlled deployment process.

#### Helm Charts - The Blueprint for Deployments

Helm Charts serve as the blueprint for our application deployments. They define the configuration, dependencies, and settings required for each application's performance. Helm charts provide a structured and version-controlled way to manage our application deployments, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.

#### Ingress - The Set Designers

Ingress definitions, a part of the Helm charts, act as the set designers for our application's ingress points. They define the routing rules and access points for our applications, ensuring that they are accessible to users. Ingress configurations are seamlessly deployed by Argo CD as part of the overall deployment process.

### The Result? A Controlled and Seamless Workflow

This orchestrated workflow guarantees that our infrastructure and applications remain synchronized with our code. Updates and deployments occur seamlessly, maintaining a high level of control and consistency throughout the process. As a result, we ensure a stable and reliable experience for our end-users.
