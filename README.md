## ðŸš€ Automated GitOps Workflow in Action

Welcome to the core of our GitOps project, where automation takes center stage. This section offers an in-depth exploration of the mechanics of our automated GitOps workflow and introduces the pivotal roles played by key components.

### ðŸ§° Key Components

Let's dive into the heart of our system by introducing the critical components responsible for the orchestration of this automation symphony:

#### Terragrunt

![Terragrunt](https://example.com/terragrunt.png)

**Role:** Terragrunt serves as the Infrastructure Maestro. It designs and provisions AWS resources, ensuring that your infrastructure aligns seamlessly with your code.

#### GitHub Actions

![GitHub Actions](https://example.com/github-actions.png)

**Role:** GitHub Actions acts as the Composer of Containers. It is responsible for creating Docker images with precision, transforming code changes into containerized artifacts.

#### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

![ECR](https://example.com/ecr.png)

**Role:** ECR functions as the Gallery of Images. It safely stores Docker images, ready to be deployed on the Kubernetes stage.

#### Argo CD

![Argo CD](https://example.com/argo-cd.png)

**Role:** Argo CD serves as the Conductor of Deployments. It monitors ECR for new images and orchestrates their deployment to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts.

#### Helm Charts

![Helm](https://example.com/helm.png)

**Role:** Helm Charts act as the Scriptwriters of Deployments. They compose intricate deployment blueprints, dictating every aspect of configuration.

#### Ingress

![Ingress](https://example.com/ingress.png)

**Role:** Ingress plays the role of Set Designers of Access. It crafts access points and routing rules, which are an integral part of Helm charts.

#### New Stack

![New Stack](https://example.com/new-stack.png)

**Role:** Introducing our latest addition, the "New Stack," which further enhances our automation prowess. Detailed documentation for this component can be found in the New Stack folder.
