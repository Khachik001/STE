## ðŸš€ Automated GitOps Workflow in Action

Welcome to the core of our GitOps project, where automation takes center stage. This section offers an in-depth exploration of the mechanics of our automated GitOps workflow and introduces the pivotal roles played by key components.

### ðŸ§° Key Components

Let's dive into the heart of our system by introducing the critical components responsible for the orchestration of this automation symphony:

| Component                | Role                                                   | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Terragrunt](https://example.com/terragrunt.png) | **Terragrunt** |Designs and provisions AWS resources, ensuring infrastructure aligns seamlessly with code.        |
| ![GitHub Actions](https://example.com/github-actions.png) | **GitHub Actions** | Responsible for building Docker images automatically whenever code changes are pushed. |
| ![ECR](https://example.com/ecr.png) | **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** |  Stores Docker images securely, making them available for deployment. |
| ![Argo CD](https://example.com/argo-cd.png) | **Argo CD** | Monitors ECR for new images and directs their deployment to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts. |
| ![Helm](https://example.com/helm.png) | **Helm Charts** | Compose application blueprints, dictating every aspect of deployment configuration. |
| ![Ingress](https://example.com/ingress.png) | **Ingress** | Define access points and routing rules, a pivotal part of Helm charts. |

### ðŸ“œ Configuration Details
