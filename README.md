## ðŸš€ Automated GitOps Workflow in Action

Welcome to the core of our GitOps project, where automation takes center stage. This section offers an in-depth exploration of the mechanics of our automated GitOps workflow and introduces the pivotal roles played by key components.

### ðŸ§° Key Components

Let's dive into the heart of our system by introducing the critical components responsible for the orchestration of this automation symphony:

| Component                | Role                                                   | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Terragrunt](https://example.com/terragrunt.png) | **Terragrunt** | Terragrunt serves as the Infrastructure Maestro. It designs and provisions AWS resources, ensuring that your infrastructure aligns seamlessly with your code. |
| ![GitHub Actions](https://example.com/github-actions.png) | **GitHub Actions** | GitHub Actions acts as the Composer of Containers. It is responsible for creating Docker images with precision, transforming code changes into containerized artifacts. |
| ![ECR](https://example.com/ecr.png) | **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** | ECR functions as the Gallery of Images. It safely stores Docker images, ready to be deployed on the Kubernetes stage. |
| ![Argo CD](https://example.com/argo-cd.png) | **Argo CD** | Argo CD serves as the Conductor of Deployments. It monitors ECR for new images and orchestrates their deployment to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts. |
| ![Helm](https://example.com/helm.png) | **Helm Charts** | Helm Charts act as the Scriptwriters of Deployments. They compose intricate deployment blueprints, dictating every aspect of configuration. |
| ![Ingress](https://example.com/ingress.png) | **Ingress** | Ingress plays the role of Set Designers of Access. It crafts access points and routing rules, which are an integral part of Helm charts. |

### ðŸ“œ Configuration Details

To gain an in-depth understanding of how each component operates and how to configure them to suit your specific requirements, please refer to the dedicated documentation available in their respective folders:

| Component                | Configuration Documentation Folder |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Terragrunt** | [Terragrunt folder](link-to-terragrunt) |
| **ECR** | [ECR folder](link-to-ecr) |
