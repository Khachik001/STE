# Terraform/Terragrunt Infrastructure Deployment Project

Welcome to our Terraform and Terragrunt project for deploying a comprehensive AWS infrastructure stack and Kubernetes cluster for your applications. This project automates the setup of essential components, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster, Ingress controller, Argo CD, and an application with an image updater.

## Project Overview

In today's cloud-native world, managing infrastructure and deploying applications efficiently is crucial. This repository simplifies this process by providing infrastructure as code (IaC) templates using Terraform and Terragrunt. By following the step-by-step documentation in this README, you can easily create a well-structured, scalable, and reliable environment for your applications.

### Key Features

- **Modular Design**: We've organized our codebase into manageable modules, making it easier to understand, maintain, and scale your infrastructure.

- **GitOps Workflow**: Utilize Argo CD for GitOps automation, ensuring that your application deployments and updates are version-controlled and auditable.

- **Highly Customizable**: The Terraform variables and Terragrunt configurations allow you to adapt the infrastructure to your specific requirements.

- **Documentation**: This README provides detailed instructions on setting up and deploying your infrastructure and applications, ensuring a smooth onboarding process for your team.
